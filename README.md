# Spotify Api App
Hello! This is my personal project which makes use of Spotify REST API and 0Auth 2.0

It was built using the boilerplate 'create-react-app' and is meant to display data from spotify about your favourite songs or your profile, which could be otherwise quite difficult to find. Some examples would be songs popularity, positiveness or energy.

## More to come!
I would love to slightly redesign this project to show more information in an even more user friendly way. Also, display user's top songs/artists within chosen period of time (last year, 6 months etc.)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm -i`

Install all dependencies

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
